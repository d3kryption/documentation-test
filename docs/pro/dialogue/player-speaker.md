# Player Speaker

Player Speakers are the users who are part of the dialogue. This can include the primary player, or [the party](../parties).

They don't have to speak and can just be visible, or they can have fully interactive dialogue.

## Properties

Player Speakers inherit from the base [Speakers](./speakers.md) class
