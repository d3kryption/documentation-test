# Player Controller

Before we can move on, we need to create a PlayerController. Simply right-click in your Content Drawer, select Blueprint Class and choose Player Controller. We will name this BP_PlayerController.

Inside the BP_PlayerController, add the Narrative component. If you canâ€™t find this, make sure the Narrative plugin is enabled above.

Now open the BP_ThirdPersonGameMode and set the Player Controller class to your newly created BP_PlayerController.

Now open your Player Controller and add the Narrative component to the components list.
