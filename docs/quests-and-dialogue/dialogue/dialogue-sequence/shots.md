# Shots

Dialogue shots are a key part of archiving the cinematic look you want for your game. 

Narrative comes packaged with many built-in shots for you to use. 

Narrative's shot system uses Unreal's Cinematics System to give you maximum flexibility when creating the dialogue you want.

## Birds Eye

This shot is used when you want to view two characters from a distance. Imagine a bird flying around looking down.

This shot is for when you want to look at a specific area on a character.

## Medium Close Up (Dolly Zoom)

This shot is animated. It's the same as the Medium Close Up, but slowly pans in for a few seconds. This is a great example to copy if you want to make your own animated shot.
