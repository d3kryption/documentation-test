# Common UI

Welcome to the Narrative Common UI quick start guide. This guide will show you how to set up Narrative Common UI and Unreals Common UI into your project.

Narrative products all come packaged with amazing UI made to work with any platform. If you plan on using any of the UI that comes with a Narrative product, like Narrative Inventories inventory menu, or Narrative 3's Quest Journal, you'll need to install this free plugin, as most UI that comes with Narrative tools is built using this plugin.

**Q: Why do I have to install a separate plugin just to use my Narrative products UI? That seems annoying!**

**A: It allows us to do some amazing stuff we couldn't otherwise:**

- You can now use any gamepad you like with Narrative UI's since we're using Common UI
- You can change the styling of every single Narrative UI in your game by changing a single asset instead of spending hours manually changing them all individually
- UI changes and bug fixes we make do will be applied across all Narrative products
- It keeps your packaged game size smaller since all fonts and icons are stored in 1 plugin rather than having a bunch of duplicates
