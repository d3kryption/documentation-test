# Creating your HUD

To set up a simple HUD, open your Content Drawer, right click -> user interface -> Widget Blueprint and name this WBP_HUD.

Open the HUD and add a **WBP Interaction Widget**. Align this however you want to.

Finally, go back into your [Player Controller](../../player-controller/index.md), and on begin play, create the widget, promote it to a variable then add it to the viewport.
