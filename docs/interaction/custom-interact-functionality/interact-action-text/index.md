# Interact action text

To set the interaction text, select the **NarrativeInteractable** component and set its **Interactable Action Text**.

This value can be changed at runtime to display the correct action for your needs. In this example, while we are opening our door, we use the node Set Interactable **Action Text** to set the text to Open / Close depending on the door's state.

Now walking up to the custom door will show the user they can interact with it by pressing the specified keys.
