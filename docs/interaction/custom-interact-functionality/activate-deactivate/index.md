# Activate / Deactivate

It is common to disable and enable an interactable item depending on your games state. For example a character holding an item might not be able to pick things up or they might not have unlocked the right ability just yet.

This can easily be toggled using Unreal's built in Activate and Deactivate events. You can also start the interaction disabled by using the Auto Activate property.
