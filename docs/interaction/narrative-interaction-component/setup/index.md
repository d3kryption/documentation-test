# Setup

To get started you need to attach the Narrative Interaction component to a controller or your player controller. Inside the **BP_PlayerController**, add the **Narrative Interaction component**. If you canâ€™t find this, make sure the Narrative Interaction plugin is enabled above and you have restarted the editor.
