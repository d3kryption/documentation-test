# Changing keys

By default, Narrative Interaction is set up to use the Gamepad Face Button Left (Square / X) or the E key. You can easily change these to match your exact requirements.

Inside the **NarrativeCommonUI** plugin folder there is a **CommonUIInputAction** asset called **DT_NarrativeInputActions**.

Open this up and find the name of the key you wish to change. In this case, the Interact row name is going to handle the interact option. Select it and you can set the keyboard and gamepad input types.
