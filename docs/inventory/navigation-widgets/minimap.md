# Minimap

This is the minimap that sits in the corner and gives the player a map surrounding their location.

## Zooming out

You may want to zoom the minimap out, so it is not so close to the player.

This is simple to do by opening the [HUD](../installation/ui.md) where you placed the **WBP_Navigator_Map_Minimap** widget and setting the **Map Zoom** property.
