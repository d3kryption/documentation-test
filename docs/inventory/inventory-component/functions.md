# Functions

The Inventory component contains a bunch of functions to help you use the inventory how you require.

If you import the [Inventory Component](./index.md), you can view the list of functions supported.

## On Begin Looting

This function is called when the Inventory component start looting (trading, shopping) with another inventory. This function **MUST** always be [implemented](../installation/player-state.md#begin-looting) to activate the looting UI.
